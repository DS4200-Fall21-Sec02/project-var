00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:06.902
Hello everyone, our group looked at VAR data in the premier league

00:00:06.902 --> 00:00:09.022
to see if there was any biases in the VAR calls

00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:11.636
that impacted the position of teams in the Premier League table

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:14.694
All of our visualizations our linked to our main scatter plot

00:00:14.997 --> 00:00:19.263
which plots the net goals scored, which is the total goals scored minus goals conceded 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.707
and the net subjective score which indicated VAR calls for minus VAR calls against

00:00:24.707 --> 00:00:30.291
Mousing over any point on the scatter plot will provide information about the team and the data point

00:00:30.493 --> 00:00:37.827
The color of the point on the scatter plot represents the difference between the first season in 2019 versus the second season in 2020

00:00:38.168 --> 00:00:44.556
The greener the point in the scatter plot will suggest they had a better finish in the 2020 season versus the 2019 season

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.550
and the more red the point is in the scatter plot will suggest that they had a worse finish

00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:58.746
The two bar charts on either side of the scatter plot represent number of favorable var decisions on the left and the number of unfavorable var decisions on the right

00:00:58.936 --> 00:01:04.988
Brushing over any point, or group of points,&nbsp; on the scatter plot will also highlight the corresponding bar on these charts

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:10.000
Additionally, brushing over any bar will highlight the same teamâ€™s bar on the other bar chart

00:01:10.448 --> 00:01:16.351
The bottom two bar charts represents a count of favorable decisions at home games on the left and away games on the right

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.949
These charts are also linked to the scatterplot and will only represent data for teams that are currently selected on the scatterplot

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:33.662
This allows users to select a team or teams in the scatter plot, view their VAR decisions for and against, and look to see if there is any bias towards them at home or away games
