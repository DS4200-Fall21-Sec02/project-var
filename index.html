    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>Within soccer internationally, the role of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) is
    becoming increasingly ubiquitous. However, there has been high levels of
    controversy related to VAR and the biases it can give teams when utilized with the
    subjective discretion of the referee, especially within the English Premier League.
    While intended to help implement accurate decisions on calls of offsides or goal
    reversals, the opposite impact may be true. This makes it crucial to visualize the
    impact that VAR has had, and in this project, we do so for the Premier League,
    utilizing data from the past three seasons (2019-present) when VAR has been in play.
    We aim to, through visualizing the impact of VAR on team success and statistics,
    achieve the goal of determining if utilizing VAR in the Premier League, and in the
    international soccer community overall, is more counterproductive than useful, or if
    it should continue to be the new standard of refereeing.</p>


    <h2>Visualization</h2>

    <p>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</p>

      <p  style="padding-left: 630px; width:600px">This scatterplot demonstrates a comparison for each team between their net subjective score and net goal score for the two seasons VAR has been used in the Premier League. The interactive nature of our scatterplot is that it connects to all of our other visualizations through brushing and linking, as you can brush over any area within the scatterplot and it will highlight bars or make bars show up in the other bar charts, depending on which one. It therefore acts as the critical base visualization for our multi-view final product, and displays a core theme to the results of our visualization: The impact of VAR decisions on team performance in the Premier League. The bar charts on either side of the scatterplot represent favorable and unfavorable var decisions by team. Brushing over a teams point on the scatterplot well highlight their corresponding bars on the other two bar charts.
  </p>

    </div>

    <div class='vis-holder2' id='bar_chart' style="padding-left: 70px"></div>
        <p  style="padding-left: 630px; width:600px">These bar charts illustrate the number of VAR decisions, categorized by the team of VAR decision, in favor of either home or away teams across both seasons VAR has been utilized within the Premier League. The charts visualize each type of VAR call that went in favor of either home or away teams in matches. This can illustrate if a team has an advantage when playing in home or away matches within the Premier League, with respect to VAR calls, and which types of calls contribute to their advantage. Only calls that apply to teams that have been brushed over in the scatterplot will be represented.</p>
